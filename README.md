# mini-qwen-py

`mini-qwen-py` is a toy implementation of LM inference with Qwen3 for learning
purposes. It is a minimal implementation that concentrates on the model's
structure instead of inference system techniques, thus no optimizations (except
for a minimum level of KV cache and prefilling to make the generation speed not
too bad) are included.
